# kmp

[KMP (Knuth-Morris-Pratt) substring search algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%E2%80%93Morris%E2%80%93Pratt_algorithm) in [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/).

This is to keep track of the references found during research. Mainly for my own documentation.

- Found a very elegant implementation, described [here](https://twanvl.nl/blog/haskell/Knuth-Morris-Pratt-in-Haskell) by [Twan van Laarhoven](https://www.twanvl.nl/).

- The implementation above is also described in a step-by-step manner [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16694306/knuth-morris-pratt-algorithm-in-haskell).
